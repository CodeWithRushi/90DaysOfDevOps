What is CodeCommit ? 

 

CodeCommit is a managed source control service by AWS that allows users to store, manage, and version their source code and artifacts securely and at scale. It supports Git, integrates with other AWS services, enables collaboration through branch and merge workflows, and provides audit logs and compliance reports to meet regulatory requirements and track changes. Overall, CodeCommit provides developers with a reliable and efficient way to manage their codebase and set up a CI/CD pipeline for their software development projects. 

Task-01: 

Set up a code repository on CodeCommit and clone it on your local. 

Go to AWS Dashboard, Search CodeCommit and click on Create Repository.
