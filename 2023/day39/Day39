User Data in AWS:
‚Ä¢ When you launch an instance in Amazon EC2, you have the option of passing user data to the instance that can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. You can pass two types of user data to Amazon EC2: shell scripts and cloud-init directives.
‚Ä¢ You can also pass this data into the launch instance wizard as plain text, as a file (this is useful for launching instances using the command line tools), or as base64-encoded text (for API calls).
‚Ä¢ This will save time and manual effort every time you launch an instance and want to install any application on it like Apache, docker, Jenkins etc.

You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources. Read from here
