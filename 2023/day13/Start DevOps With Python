Start DevOps With Python 

 

 

What is Python? 

Python is a Open source, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language. 

It was created by Guido van Rossum 

Python consists of vast libraries and various frameworks like Django, TensorFlow, Flask, Pandas, Keras etc. 

Python is the one of the best scripting language. This Python libraries allows to write scripts to improved development life cycle. 

A Python Automation Script is platform independent also supports multi tool integration. 

How to Install Python?

Read about different Data Types in Python. 

 

	Before going to explain different data types, first we understand 

	What is Datatype 🤔? 

		Python Data Types are define what kind of data or value are stored in a variable. 

All datatypes are in lower case.  

	Here’s is the list of Python Data Types 

txt Type:- str	 

	str:- Strings are a collection of characters and always enclosed within single or double quote. 

		ex: - 

		Temp_variable= “Rushikesh Shelke” 

 

Numeric Data Types :-int,float,complex 

	int:- Integer, is a whole positive or negative number without Decimal 

		ex:- 

int :     		temp_number= 20 

 

float:- Float, is a  positive or negative number with one or more Decimal. 

	ex:- 

float : 		temp_number=20.0 

 

complex:- Complex number are written with j and “j ”is the imaginary part. 

	ex:- 

complex		temp_Complex=16j	 

 

Sequence Types:-list tuple, range 

List :     

Lists are used to store multiple values in a single variable 

List elements are ordered,changeable,and allow duplicate values. 

ex:- 

    		DevOpsTool=["Git”,”Jenkins”,”Ansible”] 

Tuple:		 

Tuples are used to store multiple values in a single variable 

Tuple elements are ordered,Unchangeable,and allow duplicate values. 

 ex:- 

DevOps_Tool=("Git”,”Jenkins”,”Ansible”) 

range		 

A Range function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default.	 

  ex:-			 

ranges=range(10) start with default 0	 

Mapping Type:-  

		i. dict:-  

Dictionaries are used to store data in a “Key: Value”	pair. 

Dictionary elements are ordered, changeable, and do not allow duplicate values. 

   ex:- 

			Info={“name": "Rushikesh Shelke” , ”Role”:”DevOps Engineer”} 

 

Set Types :- 

set 

sets are used to store multiple values in a single variable 

sets elements are unordered,Unchangeable,Unindexed and does not allow duplicate values. 

ex: - 

DevOps_Tools={"Git”,”Jenkins”,”Ansible”} 

 frozenset 

	  ex:- 

	 DevOps_Tools=frozenset({"Git”,”Jenkins”,”Ansible”})	 

Boolean Type :-  

Bool 

Booleans represent one of two values: True or False. 

		ex:- 

flag=True
