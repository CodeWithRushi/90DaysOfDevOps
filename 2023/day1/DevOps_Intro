our job are run automatically.

Scaling:-
Scaling can be defined as a process to expand the existing 
configuration (servers/computers) to handle a large 
number of user requests or to manage the amount of load 
on the server. This process is called scalability. This can 
be done either by increasing the current system 
configuration (increasing RAM, number of servers) or 
adding more power to the configuration.
There are 2 types:
→ Vertical Scaling- increasing the capacity of a same 
machine by adding more resources such as 
storage,memory. 
→ Horizontal Scaling - adding more instances of the same 
type of machine
