Why we need Cloud Based Monitoring? 

Cloud monitoring is the practice of measuring workloads inside cloud tenancies against specific metrics and thresholds. 

Cloud monitoring allows you to find out if your cloud-hosted applications are performing within their Service-Level Agreement (SLA), discover any potential security risks, identify any capacity issues, and analyze costs. 

Cost optimization 

By monitoring cloud, we can track resource utilization and, from there, optimize cost. 

Performance 

Discovering the  cloud-based applications running status. 

Security 

Cloud monitoring can help you with security. By examining the application, server, API gateway, or firewall logs, a monitoring solution can alert you of anomalies 

 

Amazon CloudWatch Events: 

Amazon CloudWatch Events is a part of Amazon CloudWatch which delivers ‚Äúa real time stream of system events‚Äù that allows you to monitor and respond to the changes in your AWS Resources. 

Amazon CloudWatch Logs:
