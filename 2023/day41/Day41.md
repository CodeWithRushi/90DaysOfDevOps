LB2 

Hi, I hope you had a great day yesterday learning about the launch template and instances in EC2. Today, we are going to dive into one of the most important concepts in  

EC2: Load Balancing. 

 

What is Load Balancing? 

Load balancing is the distribution of workloads across multiple servers to ensure consistent and optimal resource utilization. It is an essential aspect of any large-scale and scalable computing system, as it helps you to improve the reliability and performance of your applications. 

Elastic Load Balancing: 

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. ELB provides three types of load balancers:

Application Load Balancer (ALB) - operates at layer 7 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require advanced routing and microservices.

Network Load Balancer (NLB) - operates at layer 4 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require high throughput and low latency.

Classic Load Balancer (CLB) - operates at layer 4 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require basic load balancing features.

üéØ Today's Tasks: 

 

Task 1: 

launch 2 EC2 instances with an Ubuntu AMI and use User Data to install the Apache Web Server. 

Login to your EC2 Dashboard and click on Launch Template.

Paste EC2 Public Ip address:<port no> to browser 

Hey, our Apache Server is Running.

Modify the index.html file to include your name so that when your Apache server is hosted, it will display your name also do it for 2nd instance which include " TrainWithShubham Community is Super Awesome :) ". 

Copy the public IP address of your EC2 instances. 

Open a web browser and paste the public IP address into the address bar. 

You should see a webpage displaying information about your PHP installation. 

 

If you are not able to write custom content inside var/www/html/index.html. 

Then simply you change the permission using chmod command. 

		sudo chmod 477 index.html

Task 2: 

Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in EC2 using the AWS Management Console. 

Click on Load Balancer option on the left side and create a Load Balancer.
